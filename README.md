# Art-Gallery-Management-System
The Art Gallery Management System (AGMS) is a web-based application built using PHP and MySQL that enables efficient management of artworks, artists, users, and orders within an online gallery. It provides three role-based modules—Users can browse, view, and purchase artworks; Artists can register, upload, and manage their artworks; and Admin can oversee the entire system by managing users, artists, artworks, and orders. The system supports artwork uploads with images, detailed artwork descriptions, and secure login functionality for all roles. It features CRUD operations for managing records, role-based access control, and a clean, user-friendly interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The database includes tables for users, artists, artworks, admins, and orders, ensuring organized storage and retrieval of information. Designed for scalability and real-world utility, AGMS offers smooth navigation, centralized control, and a structured workflow, making it an ideal solution for managing digital art galleries.
